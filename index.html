                <p>At Mountain Trail Tours we want everyone to experience the wonders of the Rocky Mountains and we 
                    invite you to join us while we explore all that Colorado's mountains have to offer. We have hiking boots,
                    backpacking packs, water bladders, waterproof clothing and so much more available for rent, as well
                    as tour guides to help you through everything before, during, and after your trip. Happy trails!

                        <p>Does the prospect of hiking 14,000ft mountains make you woozy? Not to worry! There are plenty of 
                            trails that don't require expert-level hiking experience. There are also activities that allow
                            you to be in the mountains with minimal walking. Taking the ski lift in Telluride anyone?

                            wildlife--from a distance, of course.
